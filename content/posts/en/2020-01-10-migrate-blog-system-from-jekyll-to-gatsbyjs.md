> **Spoiler Alert:** NO, I DON'T

For something that simple like blog system, the complexities of moving from jekyll to gatsby is not woth it. Here the reason why I'm considering migrating my blog system:

- I don't use ruby
- I'm familiar with javascript and react

The reason why I don't migrate:

- For static content like blog, I would like to avoid javascript if possible
- Migrating process is painfull that I give up midway
- The generated artifact is too large (gatsby => 2.5Mb, jekyll => 500Kb)
